//Steps to run this app..

// npm install --force
//npm start

// for user login : 
username:test@gmail.com
password:Qwerty123

//for admin login 
username:admin@gmail.com
password:Qwerty123


Note: these values are hardcore we will set in future with database which gives you more functionality for saving your own username and password

although if you want to change you can change it by data.json file in the app 
Note: name for normal user keep a role : user and for admin role:admin

DAtabase: we created a dummy server with the help of json-server inside which this data.json lies 

for running server :
in terminal
json-server --watch data.json --port 8080;
